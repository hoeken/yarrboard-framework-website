  - First connection errors now properly disconnect and notify admin users with error details
  - Changed `connect()` method to accept optional `waitBlocking` parameter for non-blocking connection attempts
  - Replaced `disconnect()` calls with `forceStop()` for proper MQTT client shutdown

# v2.2.1

- Moved MQTT configuration handling from `ProtocolController` to `MQTTController` for better separation of concerns
- Added MQTT connection status to stats hook via `generateStatsHook()` instead of embedding in protocol controller
- Improved MQTT connection management with proper connect/disconnect lifecycle and connection retry handling

# v2.2.0

## 🏗️ Controller System

- Added `generateCapabilitiesHook()` to `BaseController` for reporting hardware capabilities
  - Controllers can now populate a `capabilities` object in the board configuration
  - Enables frontend to conditionally show/hide features based on available hardware
